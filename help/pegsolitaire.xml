	<title>Introduction</title> 
	<para>
Peg Solitaire is a board game for one player involving movement of pegs on a board with holes.  The first evidence of peg solitaire can be traced back to the court of Louis XIV, and the specific date of 1697.  It was made popular in more recent history by the board game marketed as Hi-Q.

	<title>Objective</title>
	<para>
The goal of the game is to remove pegs from the board leaving a single peg in the centre hole.  Pegs are removed from the board by making "jumps".  You can jump over a peg with another peg horizontally or vertically (not diagonally!).  When you jump over a peg, it is removed from the board.  Multiple jumps with one peg are allowed.
